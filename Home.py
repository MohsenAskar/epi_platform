Welcome to the Interactive Epidemiology Platform! 

This educational tool helps you understand key 
epidemiological concepts through interactive visualizations and examples.

### Available epidemiological modules:
- **Correlation**: Understand the relationship between two variables
- **Stratification**: Observe how data is split into groups
- **Confounding**: See how a third variable affects the relationship between two others
- **Effect Modification**: Observe how the effect of one variable changes based on another
- **Selection Bias**: Understand how bias can affect study results
- **Measures of Association**: Learn about key measures like Risk Ratio, Odds Ratio, and Hazard Ratio
- **Epidemiological Study Designs**: Explore different study designs like Cohort, Case-Control, and Cross-Sectional
- **Causal Inference and DAGs**: Understand the concept of causality and Directed Acyclic Graphs
- **Statistical Methods in Epidemiology**: Learn about statistical tests like logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards, and more
- **Screening and Diagnostic Tests**: Understand the concepts of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
- **Disease Frequency and Measures**: Learn about measures of disease frequency
- **Meta-Analysis and Systematic Reviews**: Understand the process of combining results from multiple studies
- **Machine Learning in Epidemiology**: Explore the basic concepts of machine learning in epidemiology
- **Network Analysis in Epidemiology**: Learn about network analysis and its applications in epidemiology
- **Target Trial Emulation in Epidemiology**: Understand the concept of target trial emulation
- **Quantitative Bias Analysis**: Learn about the concept of quantitative bias analysis
- **Clinical Epidemiology**: Learn about the application of epidemiology in clinical settings
- **Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology**: Learn about the application of epidemiology in environmental and occupational settings
- **Time-to-Event (Survival) Analysis**: Understand the concept of time-to-event analysis
- **Longitudinal Data Analysis**: Learn about the analysis of longitudinal data
- **Time Series Analysis**: Learn about the analysis of time series data
- **Bayesian Methods in Epidemiology**:  Learn about the application of Bayesian methods in epidemiology
- **Data Management & Wrangling for Epidemiology**:  Learn about data management and wrangling techniques for epidemiological data
